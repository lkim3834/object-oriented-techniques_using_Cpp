Copy all of the files in this directory into the student's
directory.  For each point deduction, give a reason.  Numbers in
parens are the max points for each check.

Grade only one partner's code and assign them the same score.

*****************************************************************

SOURCE CODE.

     Run mk.build

     (3) Checksource did not complain.  No extra files were
         submitted, except as per asgt spec.  Header files
         must end with .h and implementation files with .cpp.

     (3) Used good consistent indentation.  Did not use any
         one-letter idents, used only meaningful idents.
         Did not leave any commented-out code interspersed
         with running code.

     (3) In both commands.cc(cpp) and file_sys.cc(cpp), used a throw to
         report errors, which is caught in main().

     In the module commands.cc(cpp):  Check for reasonable code and a
     proper implementation of:

     (3) fn_cd, fn_echo, fn_exit, fn_prompt, fn_pwd

     (3) fn_cat, fn_make, fn_makedir

     (3) fn_ls, fn_lsr

     (3) fn_rm, fn_rmr

     In file_sys.cc(cpp):  Check for reasonable code in:

     (3) readfile, writefile

     (3) mkdir, mkfile (but it is also OK if these are done
         in the constructor instead.

     (3) Proper additions to inode_state

*****************************************************************

PROGRAM TESTING:

     If mk.build failed to create an executable binary,
     stop here.  No output points if it does not build.

     Run mk.tests
     Check each test run *.out and *.err for the expected output.
     Assign partial credit for partially correct output.

     (5) test0.ysh

     (4) test1.ysh

     (4) test2.ysh

     (4) test3.ysh

     (4) test4.ysh

     Other checks.

     (4) Deduct 4 points if the valgrind test indicated memory
         leaks, invalid memory references, or any other complaint.

     (5) Deduct 3 points here if any test run seg faulted,
         dumped core, or otherwise terminated abnormally.
         Deduct 5 points if more than one test did so.

If pair programming, TOTALSCORE = SUBTOTAL - TOTAL1.
If not, TOTALSCORE = SUBTOTAL.
