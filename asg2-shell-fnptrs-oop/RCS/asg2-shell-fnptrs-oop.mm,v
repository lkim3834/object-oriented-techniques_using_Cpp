The program will involve object-oriented programming using
virtual functions,

as shown in the following table.

.H 1 "Program specification"
The program specification is given in terms of a Unix 
.V= man (1)
page.
.SH=BVL
.B=LI "NAME"
yshell
\[em]
in memory simulated tree shell
.B=LI "SYNOPSIS"
.V= yshell
.=V \|[ -@@
.IR flags ]
.B=LI "DESCRIPTION"
This shell reads commands from the standard input and write output to
the standard output,
with errors being written to
the standard error.
Each line read by the shell is parsed into words by splitting
using space characters, 
with any number of spaces between words.
There may also be leading and trailing spaces.
The first word on any line is a command to be simulated,
and the rest are operands to that command.
If either the standard input or the standard output is not a tty,
each line from the standard input is echoed to the standard output.
.P
The commands modify an inode tree,
where each inode is either a file or a directory.
Files contain data and directories contain inodes.
An inode is specified by means of a pathname.
A pathname consists of a sequence of characters separated by
slash
.=V ( / )
characters.
.P
The inode tree has a root, which is a special node,
and also a current inode as well.
Whenever a pathname is decoded,
if the first character is a slash
.=V ( / ),
decoding begins at the root,
otherwise it begins with the current directory.
Whenever a pathname component is a dot
.=V ( . ),
it refers to the current directory.
If a component is a double dot
.=V ( .. )
it refers to the parent of the current directory.
Every directory has both of these entries,
with the root being its own parent.
Multiple adjacent slashes are treated as a single slash.
Trailing slashes are permitted only on directories.
.P
Every inode has three attributes\(::
an inode number, which is uniquely assigned,
starting from 1 for the root\(;;
contents, which is a map from filenames to inodes for a directory,
and text for a file\(;;
and a size, which is the byte count for text,
and the number of sub-inodes for a directory.
.B=LI "OPERANDS"
None.
All input comes from the standard input.
.B=LI "OPTIONS"
The
.V= -@@
option is followed by a sequence of flags to enable debug output,
written to
the standard error.
.B=LI "COMMANDS"
The following commands are interpreted.
Error messages are printed and nothing is done in the case
of invalid operands.
.BVL \n[Pi]
.LI "\f[CB]#\f[R] \|\f[I]string\f[R]"
If the first non-space character on a line is a hash,
the line is a comment and is ignored.
.LI "\f[CB]cat\f[R] \|\f[I]pathname\*[dots]\f[R]"
The contents of each file is copied to the standard output.
An error is reported if no files are specified,
a file does not exist,
or is a directory.
.LI "\f[CB]cd\f[R] \|[\f[I]pathname\f[R]]"
The current directory is set the the pathname given.
If no pathname is specified, the root directory
.=V ( / )
is used.
It is an error if the pathname does not exist or is a plain file,
or if more than one operand is given.
.LI "\f[CB]echo\f[R] \|[\f[I]words\*[dots]\f[R]]"
The string, which may be empty, is echoed to the standard output on a
line by
itself.
.LI "\f[CB]exit\f[R] \|[\f[I]status\f[R]]"
Exit the program with the given status.
If the status is missing, exit with status 0.
If a non-numeric argument is given, exit with status 127.
.LI "\f[CB]ls\f[R] \|[\f[I]pathname\*[dots]\f[R]]"
A description of the files or directories are printed to the standard
output.
It is an error if any of the file or directory does not exist.
If no pathname is specified, the current working directory is used.
If a pathname specified is a directory,
then the contents of the directory are listed.
A directory listed within a directory is shown by a terminating slash.
Elements of a directory are listed lexicographically.
.P
For each file listed,
output consists of
the inode number, then the size, then the filename.
Output is lined up into columns and each column is separated
from the next by two spaces.
The numeric fields are exactly 6 characters wide and the units
position in a column must be aligned.
.LI "\f[CB]lsr\f[R] \|[\f[I]pathname\*[dots]\f[R]]"
As for \f[CB]ls\f[R],
but a recursive depth-first preorder traversal
is done for subdirectories.
.LI "\f[CB]make\f[R] \|\f[I]pathname\f[R] \|[\f[I]words\*[dots]\f[R]]"
The file specified is created and the rest of the words are put
in that file.
If the file already exists,
a new one is not created, but its contents are replaced.
It is an error to specify a directory.
If there are no words, the file is empty.
.LI "\f[CB]mkdir\f[R] \|\f[I]pathname\f[R]"
A new directory is created.
It is an error if a file or directory of the same name already exists,
or if the complete pathname to the parent of this new directory
does not already exist.
Two entries are added to the directory, namely dot
.=V ( . )
and dotdot
.=V ( .. ).
Directory entries are always kept in sorted lexicographic order.
.LI "\f[CB]prompt\f[R] \|\f[I]string\f[R]"
Set the prompt to the words specified on the command line.
Each word is separated from the next by one space and the prompt
itself is terminated by an extra space.
The default prompt is a single percent sign and a space
.=V ( %\[VS] ).
.LI "\f[CB]pwd\f[R]"
Prints the current working directory.
.LI "\f[CB]rm\f[R] \|\f[I]pathname\f[R]"
The specified file or directory is deleted
(removed from its parent's list of files and subdirectories).
It is an error for the pathname not to exist.
If the pathname is a directory, it must be empty.
.LI "\f[CB]rmr\f[R] \|\f[I]pathname\f[R]"
A recursive removal is done, 
using a depth-first postorder traversal.

.V= verify ,
and
.V= deps ,
which perform their usual functions.
.V=LI debug.{h,cpp}
The
.V= debug
module is already written for you.
It is useful in tracing through your code.
Other parts of the code may want to have more 
.V= DEBUGF
and
.V= DEBUGS
calls added.
Note that you should also use
.V= gdb
to track down bugs.
Use
.V= valgrind
to check for invalid memory references and memory leak.
.V=LI util.{h,cpp}
The
.V= util
module is just a collection of independent functions which are
herded together.
It is a module without any cohesion,
but a useful place to park various random functions.
.V=LI main.cpp
The main program is mostly complete.
It scans options, then loops reading and executing commands.
.V=LI commands.{h,cpp}
Note that the functions are provided but do not do more than print
a trace.
Each function as a 
.V= inode_state 
argument, passed by reference, which it might update,
and a
.V= wordvec
arlgument.
.V= words[0]
is the name of the command itself,
so the first argument is
.V= words[1] .
This will take the most work, but commands can be added one at a time,
by addition to the organization that is already there.
You may add private functions is you need to.
This is the major execution engine.
.V=LI file_sys.{h,cpp}
The 
.V= inode ,
or file system, module is the main data structure that you are working
on.
As you implement commands,
also implement the functions of this module as well.
.H 1 "What to submit"
Submit the files
.V= Makefile ,
.V= README ,
and all C++ header and source files.
All header files must end with
.V= \&.h ,
and source files must end with
.V= \&.cpp
as the suffix.
.P
Run
.V= gmake
to verify that the build is possible.
And when you run
.V= submit ,
do so from the 
.V= Makefile
target of that name.
That way you won't forget to submit a file.
If you forget to submit a file,
or submit the wrong version,
you will lose at least 50% of your program's value.
Make sure that you do not get any warnings from
.V= g++
and that
.V= checksource
and
.V= cpplint.py.perl
dot not complain about anything.
Be sure that
.V= valgrind
shows no uninitialized variables and no memory leak.
Do not submit any file that is built by the
.V= Makefile .
.P
If you are doing pair programming,
follow the additional instructions in\(::
.VTCODE* 1 \
/afs/cats.ucsc.edu/courses/cse111-wm/Syllabus/pair-programming
Note that points will be deducted for an improperly formatted
.V= PARTNER
file.
.P
The code must compile and run using
.V= g++
on
.V= unix.ucsc.edu ,
regardless of whether it runs elsewhere.
When this document was formatted (\*[OLDDATE])
that was\(::
.DS
.in +\n[VCODENWIDTH]u
.ft CR
.UNIX_COMMAND "which g++"
.UNIX_COMMAND "g++ --version | head -1"
.UNIX_COMMAND "uname -srp"
.UNIX_COMMAND "hostname"
.DE
.H 1 "Instructions to graders"
Look in the
.V= \&.score/
subdirectory for instructions to graders.
