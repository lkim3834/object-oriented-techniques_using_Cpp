Copy all of the files in this directory into the student's
directory.  For each point deduction, give a reason.  Numbers in
parens are the max points for each check.

Check to see if they are working alone or doing pair
programming.  If pair programming, they should have a symlink to
their partner's directory.  If it is not there, you should make
one.  Grade only one partner's code and assign them the same score.

*****************************************************************

SOURCE CODE.

     Grader: examine code only in cxi.cpp and cxid.cpp.
     If students submitted both cxi and cix files, ignore
     the older files.  Use the files named in Makefile.

     Run mk.build

     (3) Checksource was silent, did not complain.  No extra
         files were submitted, except as per asgt spec.
         C++ source are all called .h or .cpp as appropriate.
         (.cc suffix also ok instead of .cpp)

     (3) Indentation, formatting, and identifier names readable.
         Did not leave any commented-out code interspersed
         with running code.

     (3) client get - code to parse command, make packet to
         send to server, and receive data reply.  Code to
         save file in current directory.

     (3) server get - responds to get request, ifstream to
         open file and load into buffer.  Send back in  a
         FILE packet

     (3) client put - code to open file, load into buffer,
         make PUT packet and send it, follow by payload
         containing file bytes.  Accept ACK or NAK

     (3) server put - code to accept PUT followed by payload
         open file and save.  Send back ACK or NAK

     (3) client rm - parse command and send header, receive
         reply.

     (3) server rm - accept packet call unlink(2), send back
         reply.

     (3) server ACK NAK check on any syscalls and send an ACK
         for success and a NAK with errno for fail.
         client:  print an OK message for an ACK and a 
         syserror message for a NAK.

     (3) somewhere in one or more files are functions to read
         a file into a buffer and write a file from a buffer
         Possibly in protocol, but possibly in client or
         serverl

PROGRAM TESTING:

     Run mk.build - if an executable was not built, assign 0
     points to this section.

     Note to grader:  You must be logged into unix.ucsc.edu
     using separate xterms.  Use 'hostname' to verify
     that you have logged into the SAME machine.

     In one xterm, edit the SCORE file so you can record things
     that happen.

     Instructions for copying in .score are a little different:
     cp -R .score/* .
     that way the two subdirectories local and remote are
     copied into the student's directory.
     For each test, keep a typescript of the testing.

     daemon:
     in the daemon, cd remote:
     which cxid
     script daemon.log1
     ../cxid 8888 (or whatever port works for you)

     in the client xterm: cd local
     script client.log
     ../cxi localhost 8888

     That starts things, then move back and forth between each
     of the clients watching the daemon chatter.
     For the following, type in a command to see if it works.
     the prefix tells you which client to test.

     Do not examine any files until you exit from script.
     After exiting from script, answer the following questions.
     This requires two passes by the grader.

     (4) client: ls
         do you get the output?

     (4) client: put localfile
         client: put localtto
         did the server respond?

     (4) client: ls
         are the new files there?

     (4) client: get server1file
         is the file now in client's directory?

     (4) client: rm to-remove
         does client now have client's local file
         were the server files unlinked?

     (4) client: rm no-such-file
         Suitable error message?  no change to server directory?
  
     (4) type "exit" to client, then 
         ls -la to the bash shell
         exit will stop recording the typescript.
         after grading make sure you exit the typescript.
         Were the script log files there and did the
         file transfers take effect as usual.

     (2) These are two free points if neither client nor
         server crashed.

min 0, max 30.
